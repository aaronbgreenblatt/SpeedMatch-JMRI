"""
This file contains logic for measuring the length of each block in a
railroad.

We presume that the blocks are on a loop that is part of a
model railroad mainline, which is to say that each block could be straight,
curved, on a grade, or otherwise have different characteristics. Accordingly,
we use a locomotive set at a steady throttle setting to calibrate the
length of each block, with the user supplying one measured block (in inches)
to facilitate calculations in scale miles per hour.

    In this method, we measure the time in each block. Since a block should
    be active from when the front of an engine enters to when the rear of
    an engine leaves, we don't measure time from on until off. Instead, we watch
    for the activation of the first sensor - say LS1 - and then establish the
    block travel time as when the next sensor - say LS2 - becomes active,
    thereby measuring from the front of the engine to the front of the engine.

    If the block detector has non-deterministic delays from actual engine entry
    to sensor activation, this approach may cause problems. Dirty wheel pickups
    may cause these sorts of issues as well. For this reason, we sample the
    travel time on each block multiple times. Also see comments in the writeup
    about how, if you have "similar" blocks (i.e. all curves, all the same
    length, in a circle), then the velocity in each block should be the same
    for a given throttle setting, and accordingly you can use least squares
    across all the blocks to get a better time estimate. This won't work if
    the blocks are different (i.e. on your railroad mainline) and therefore
    the speed of the engine changes due to hills, curves, etc.

    One can optionall save to or load from disk, as this method is what takes
    most of the time in the SpeedMatch routine, waiting for the train to run
    around in circles.
